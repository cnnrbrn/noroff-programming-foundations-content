# Course Assignment

The Level 1 questions are required.

The Level 2 questions are optional, but you will receive feedback on them if you submit them.

A lot of the questions don't suggest variable names, and you must come up with them yourselves.

Choosing sensible variable names will form part of your assessment.

## Level 1

##### Question 

Create an `array` of five numbers.

Loop through the array and console log each value.

---

##### Question

Create a `for loop` that counts from 15 to 25. Console log the value of the counter variable inside the loop.

---

##### Question

Using the same loop from the above question, only log the value of the counter variable if it is equal to `20`.

---

##### Question 

Create an array of two objects. Each object must have the same three properties:

- one property with a string value
- one property with a number value
- one property with a boolean value

Loop through the array and console log the number and boolean value.

---

##### Question 

Create a function called `dontLikeLogger` that accepts one argument. Choose a good name for the argument.

Inside the function, log the string "I don't like " together with the argument.

Call the function and pass in a value of your choice.

---

##### Question 

Create a function that accepts two arguments.

Inside the function, subtract the second argument from the first and console log the result.

---

##### Question

Create an empty array.

Create a function that accepts one argument.

Inside the function, add the argument to the array.

Call the function and pass in a value of any type.

---

## Level 2

##### Question 

Using the loop from question x in level 1, log only the counter variable if it is an even number. 

Hint: you can use the modulus `%` operator for this.


##### Question 

Create a function that logs the sentence "I am a function".

Assign this function to a variable called `myFunction`. 

Create another function that accepts one argument.

Call the second function and pass in the `myFunction` variable.


## Submission

- Create a repository in your GitHub account called `prog-found-ca` and make sure it's public
- Create a file called `level-1.js`
- If you answer the level 2 questions, answer them in a file called `level-2.js`
- Write your answers inside this file with a comment above each answer indicating the question number:

```js

// question 1

// your answer for question 1 goes here

// question 2

// your answer for question 2 goes here

// etc

```

- Add, commit and push this file to your repo
- Submit the repo link
