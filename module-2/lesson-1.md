# Arrays

More on arrays.

Arrays are lists of values in square brackets. Each value is separated by a comma `,`.

In the last module, we used a `for loop` to loop through an array of stings, the array of colours.

```js
var colours = ["red", "blue", "green", "yellow"];
```

Arrays can hold any kind of values.


Here is an array of numbers.
```js
var numbers = [6, 54, 17, 108];
```

Here is an array of booleans.
```js
var numbers = [true, false, false, true];
```
